# Is it raining?

This repository contains simple project that uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org) to show current weather data for user selected location.
Application is really simple and its purpose was for me to learn iOS and SwfitUI programming.

## Used technologies

- Async programming
- JSON
- HTTP(S) requests

## Building

The only non standard step to build this project is to create `Config.plist` inside `Config` folder.
Repository already contains `Config.draft.plist` file in required location.
All you need to do is, based on draft file, create your own and provide your OpeWeather API key, so the app can use it.
